In  this class, she has to perform various task that deals with word processors. She has at least 4 papers to write, one being a research paper, which means including graphs for statistical purposes, and it is required to have a word processor that will format her papers properly.

So, Suzy got introduced to a word processor titled Libre Office that is free and convenient.


## Technical Background and Competencies of Audience

Technology has become very popular in the 21st century. Therefore, it is a given that the student will have a smartphone and/or a computer.

With this fact alone, it brings assurance that online processors will not die out due to the fact technology is the new thing and is constantly being used. Meaning, Libreoffice will be around throughout the student's college career. For it is known, that despite the negative such as cyber attacks, etc, the internet is constantly expanding. It is constantly tying machines to machines, resulting in resources for people.
