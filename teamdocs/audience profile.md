## Scenario

Suzy is a college freshman at the University who must take Writing 101 as a prerequisite for courses in her major field: she plans to study journalism. This introductory composition course naturally requires that she write and submit a number of various types of papers, including an in-depth inquiry paper. Her problem is that her new laptop, which cost all of her summer job earnings, did not come with a word processing application, and she does not have any money left to purchase a Microsoft Office subscription. To her relief, her professor tells her about a set of tools she can access at no cost, called LibreOffice, which includes a word processing application that is compatible with Microsoft Word. Suzy is by no means a technology whiz, but she figures she better give it try if she is going to excel in this course as the first step toward her goal of becoming a professional writer. 


## Technical Background and Competencies of Audience

With technology an integral part of daily life for the average individual in the US, it would be expected for Suzy to have a smartphone and/or a computer (we know that Suzy just got a new laptop). She would also come to college having some experience using computers for online research and word processing. All the way back in 2010, Pew Research Center surveys found that even young adults who did NOT attend college used the internet at a rate of 92%. Nearly 100% of college students accessed the internet. By 2017 Suzy would be extremely comfortable using tech devices for schoolwork and leisure. She would probably be adept at installing new applications on these devices as well and at doing some basic troubleshooting should problems arise. 


## Limitations of our guide to LibreOffice Writer for Suzy

Even though we invented Suzy, we do not know exactly how skilled she is in using technology or precisely what her technical background is, and therefore our documentation may be too basic or in the other direction, may assume she knows some things that she doesn’t. Also, we are assuming that she got a Macbook Pro, but she might have a Windows machine. Our documentation will be geared toward the Mac. Finally, while we can imagine the types of assignments she will work on in Writing 101, we are not privy to the actual syllabus, and so there may be a few tasks she will be asked to carry out that our user’s manual will not address. Those are some possible limitations that we foresee with our guide as written.
