Team 2 Progress Report 1 for Project #2  
For the week ending June 18
 
Team members: Madison, Kristin, Keyere, and Elizabeth
 
 
Accomplishments  

We were able to come together as a team and complete our first major project, the team charter. Even though we are very busy in our lives outside of this course, we were able to connect and communicate. Slack and Google docs were very useful! We hope that we have laid the groundwork for communication to flow efficiently for the rest of the project.
 
 
Challenges  

We had a schedule conflict when it came to our first planned meeting via video chat. It is a challenge to work on a team of people who have never met face to face and who all have multiple other responsibilities.
 
 
Questions  

What open source software are we going to document? Will we be able to come together as a team to execute this project in one short week? 
 
 
Upcoming  

This week we have a lot on our plate. We have to actually work on and complete the project for which we have created the team contract. We really need to set day by day goals so that we can meet the deadline of delivering the documentation by next Sunday.
