### MLA Formatting Your Paper

1. Use standard paper sized 8.5 x 11 inches. This is the default size for LO Writer.

2. Use 1-inch margins. Change margins by clicking on the Page in the sidebar and using the drop-down menu to adjust.

3. Indent the first sentence of each paragraph 1 inch from the left margin of your paper. You can use the “Tab” key in LO Writer for this.

4. Use standard double spacing throughout the entire text of your paper. Change spacing by clicking on Properties in the sidebar. Under Spacing, very last one, is Line Spacing. Click on the drop-down menu to switch to **Spacing: 2** from the default Spacing: 1.

5. Use Times New Roman as your font. This can also be changed from the Properties sidebar:
