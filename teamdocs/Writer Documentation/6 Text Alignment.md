### Text alignment

You may need use different types of text alignment at various times. Changing these settings is not difficult.

To the far right of the default toolbar are icons representing the four standard text alignments for a page.

* **Align left** is the default. This is the text alignment you would normally use. Control + L will left align text.

* **Center** may be used to center information on a title page, for example. To do this, click on the second icon in the row before you type the text needing to be centered. Or highlight the text to be centered, and click on the center icon. Commond + E will also center text.

* **Align right** may be used for a specific paper heading. The third icon in the row will take care of this. Control + R

* **Justify** Control + J
