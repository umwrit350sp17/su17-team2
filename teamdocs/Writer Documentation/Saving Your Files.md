Now that you have begun to compose your masterpiece, you need to preserve it for future generations.
How is this achieved using LibreOffice Writer?

First, click on "File" in the top upper left of the screen and move your cursor down to "Save." (Alternately, you can also press Command + S for the same effect.)

This will result in the pop up of a box that will allow you to modify the name of the file, the location it will be saved, and the type of file it will be saved as.
