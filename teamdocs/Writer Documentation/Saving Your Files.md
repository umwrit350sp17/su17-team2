Now that you have begun to compose your masterpiece, you need to preserve it for future generations.
How is this achieved using LibreOffice Writer?

First, click on "File" in the top upper left of the screen and move your cursor down to "Save." (Alternately, you can also press Command + S for the same effect.)

This will result in the pop up of a box that will allow you to modify the name of the file, the location it will be saved, and the type of file it will be saved as.

In this screenshot you can see all the possible options for types of file you may save your document as:

As you see, the default is LibreOffice's .odt file. Because you may be sharing your files or printing documents from a computer on campus, I recommend saving your papers and reports as .docx files. This will assure that they are compatible with other users and machines working with Microsoft (currently the most widely used word processing program). Here is what that will look like:

You will get a warning message about the risks of saving your files in this format:

This is a standard warning provided before saving to other formats. The support for these formats is not flawless, however, most simple documents will translate to the other formats with no problem. It is safe to override the warning. 

(If you want to turn off the warning, and/or set LO to save to .docx by default, you can do that in Tools / Options / load and save / general.)

And that is how you save a document.
