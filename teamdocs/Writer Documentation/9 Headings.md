### Headings

From the toolbar at top of the page or from "Properties" in the sidebar at right, find the drop-down menu that reads "Default Style."

This will enable you to create various headings within your paper or book.

* Highlight the main title and select "Title" from the drop-down menu. You can do the same for the subtitle.


* For a main heading or chapter title, select "Heading 1." Subheadings would then be assigned "Heading 2."

Here is how LO Writer automatically formats these various headings:

Once you assign your various headings, you can use them to set up a Table of Contents for your paper or book that updates page numbers automatically.

To execute, click on "Insert" in toolbar at top.
Select "Table of Contents and Index" from drop-down menu.
