### Modifying Font and Type Size

Now that you know how to create a new document and save that document in Writer, let's look at the nuts and bolts of adapting your document's appearance to fit your needs.

You may want to change the font before you begin. Click on the drop down menu and select your preferred font. Here, Arial is chosen.

If you decide to change the font after you have begun writing, use the "Select all" function by pressing Control + A to highlight all text, and then follow the same procedure for changing font.

You can follow essentially the same steps to change the type size: click on the drop down menu (to the right of the font selection menu) to choose your type size.  
Similarly, if you need to change type size after you've begun the paper, select by highlighting the portions of your paper to which you want to apply the new type size first, and then select your desired type size.

You can also modify the font and type size by clicking on the "Properties" icon on the sidebar beside the right margin of the page.
