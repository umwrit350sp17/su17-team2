Introducing LibreOffice Writer

LibreOffice is an open source suite of applications that are equivalent to those of Microsoft Office. It offers applications for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics and charts, databases, and formula editing. All of these applications are compatible with Microsoft products.

The word processing application in LibreOffice is called Writer. It can be used in lieu of Microsoft Word, and it is compatible with Microsoft Word. Writer can be utilized by anyone in need of a word processing tool. It can therefore be used in an educational or professional setting to write and edit articles, reports, and other documents. A first-year college student (weâ€™re looking at you, Suzy!) would find LibreOffice Writer beneficial as it is easy to use, compatible with the product that currently dominates the market (Microsoft), yet can be obtained and used at no cost to the user.
