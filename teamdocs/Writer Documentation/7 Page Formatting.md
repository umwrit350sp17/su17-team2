### Page Formatting

To modify the size, orientation, or margins of your pages:

* Find the sidebar settings at the right of your page. 
* Click on the one that looks like a page that is called "Page" when your cursor hovers over it. 

After you click, this is what you will see:

You can then change the size of your page, the orientation (portrait or landscape), and the margins.

Default margins are set to 0.75 inch.  
For English papers requiring MLA formatting, you will need to change margins to 1 inch. This is not difficult:

simply click on the drop-down menu next to Margins and select Normal 1 inch.

As you can see from the screenshot above, you can also make other stylistic changes to your document here, such as changing the number style, formatting columns, or adding headers and/or footers.

When you are satisfied with your changes, click on a small x in the upper right of the box to "Close Sidebar Deck."
