### Modifying Text Appearance


You will find that many of the commands you may be accustomed to using in Microsoft Word are the same in LibreOffice Writer.


* To make text **bold**, click on the large B in the toolbar or use Control + B. You may apply bold retroactively by highlighting the text you wish to embolden.

* To *italicize*, click on the slanted I in the toolbar or use Control + I. Highlight text to apply the style as you wish.

* To underline, click on the large U in the tool bar or use Control + U. Highlight text to apply the style as you wish.

* To change font color, click on the drop down menu beside the icon of T with a paintdrop above a brick red line.

* To highlight text with a certain color, use the drop down menu beside the icon of a marker above a bright yellow line.

Here is a user selecting text to highlight, using the drop down menu to select color of highlighting.

Here is a view after the highlight. Also notice in this screenshot how hovering the cursor over any of the icons in the toolbar will tell you what functions they are used for. Here, hovering over the large I indicates that icon is used to create italics.
