Conflict Resolution  
We will discuss the issue until everyone comes to an agreement on how to resolve it. If we are unable to get in touch with a team member to discuss the issue, those team members who are part of the discussion will make a decision together about how to resolve it. If we agree that we cannot resolve the issue among ourselves, we will contact the instructor for advice.
 
Missed Deadlines  
Due to the short turnaround time for this project, we cannot afford to have missed deadlines. The project manager will contact the team member who missed the deadline. If she does not respond within 4 hours, the project manager will notify the other team members. At that point they will discuss and decide how to proceed. A record of the missed deadline will be recorded to inform the instructor if the missed deadline causes the overall project to be submitted late or of lesser quality than it could have been.
 
Unacceptable Work  
We define unacceptable work as that which does not meet project guidelines and shows little or no effort on the part of the team member who submits it.
The project manager will contact the team member who has submitted unacceptable work with a description of revisions that need to be made and request that the work be revised within 24 hours. If the team member who submits unacceptable work has additional questions, she should communicate as soon as possible with the project manager to plan how to address the issue.
