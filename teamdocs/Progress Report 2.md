###Team 2 Progress Report 2 for Project #2  
For the week ending July 2  

This progress report is coming from Elizabeth. In the past few days communication with my team members has been spotty. I sent an email to my team members this morning requesting any input for this report to be sent by 5 PM and did not get a response from any of them.

Accomplishments  

An audience profile and outline were submitted to the instructor for mid-way feedback.

Elizabeth will submit documentation that represents the final deliverable for the team project.


Challenges  

Our team was not able to work together effectively toward our goals. Despite using Slack, communication was a huge issue. Team members were either not able or not willing to collaborate on the project components as intended.

I do not have the sense that anyone else installed LibreOffice to see how it worked, and I do not have the sense that anyone else logged onto GitHub.

After we got feedback from the instructor on the profile and outline and Kristin gave up coordinating the documentation, I was unable to engage anyone to work on the project with me. So I just started doing it myself.

Questions  

How could I have better motivated my team members to contribute to our project?
How could we have formulated a more effective team contract?
